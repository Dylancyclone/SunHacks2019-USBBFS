# SunHacks 2019: USBBFS

Universal Serial Bus Blockchain File System

This repo contains all of the code for our submission for the SunHacks 2019 hackathon. The project was inspired by our mutual love for cryptography, data protection and analysis, and just programming in general. We wanted to integrate these parts of the coding world that inspired us into one project that we could both learn from and have fun with. We chose to use blockchain in our solution to learn more about data security and immutability in a real-world scenario. Going into the project, neither of us knew how to implement blockchain into a project, but we were able to develop a simplified model in Java for use in the final product. We also learned much about the proper practices of Java programming when we combined file transformations and cryptographic manipulation into our final product. We also learned about what not to do; one problem we struggled with was balancing Java threads to balance the processing load of the program. Over the course of the weekend, we had the opportunity to learn about more than just the programming that goes into a this kind of project.
